* SOLVE_THIS: Numeric Expression Solver
SOLVE_THIS is a program that accepts mathematical expressions in infix or postfix notation and allows for both solving them and converting between the two notations. This program is the result of a practical activity in the Data Structures course of the [[https://dcc.ufmg.br/][Department of Computer Science at UFMG]].

* Compilation
SOLVE_THIS can be compiled with the following command:

#+begin_src sh
$ make build
#+end_src

* Execution
To run the program, there are two options:
+ Interactive execution. To do this, execute the following command:

#+begin_src sh
$ make run_interactive
#+end_src

In this way, the program will start. Type =HELP= and press =enter= to view the list of possible commands.

+ Execution by passing a file containing the desired sequence of commands:

#+begin_src sh
$ make run < path/to/file
#+end_src

NOTE: The file should be structured so that there is one command per line. See some examples in [[https://github.com/luk3rr/SOLVE_THIS/tree/main/src/tests/inputs][src/tests/inputs]].

* Documentation
The first version of the documentation, as well as the task statement for this project, can be found [[https://github.com/luk3rr/SOLVE_THIS/tree/main/docs][here]].
